          users to interact with your data via natural language.
           After uploading a 
          dataset, users ask questions about or request analyses in 
          English. The app generates and runs R code to answer that question

           system, which returns R code. The R code is cleaned up and 
           executed in a Shiny 
           environment, showing results or error messages. Multiple 
           requests are logged to produce an R Markdown file, which can be
            knitted into an HTML report. This enables record keeping 
            and reproducibility."),

          p("Not entirely. This is because the generated code can be wrong.
           However, it could be used to quickly conduct data
